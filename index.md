  Hello! My name is Jaeun who wants to be a competent developer.
  I think it is important to learn step by step.
  So, i aim to studying what I don't know slowly every day.
  So far, i have studied spring framework, html, css. Finally, i made a <a href="https://github.com/Jaeun-Choi98/Introduce-web">web</a> that introduces me. 
  Recently, i'm interested in studying Linux platform and Server.
  Therefore, i am going to study them by reading related books.
