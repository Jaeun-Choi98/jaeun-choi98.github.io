  Hello! My name is Jaeun who wants to be a competent developer.
  I think it is important to learn step by step.
  So, i aim to studying what I don't know slowly every day.
  <br>
  I try to learn new technologies and apply them to produce better outcomes. 
  Valuing diverse experiences, I aim for continuous growth.
  <br>
  Lastly, i value smooth communication with team members.
  Share ideas, collaborate, solve problems effectively, and strive to achieve your team's goals.
